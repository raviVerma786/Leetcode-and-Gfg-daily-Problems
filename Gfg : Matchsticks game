Solution : 

class Solution {
  public:
 //if N is multiple of 5 then who plays first will lose and if A is able to pick some number
//of matchsticks such that number becomes multiple of 5 then B will lose definitely because
//now after picking of A, B will be first to play.............(by observation)
    int matchGame(long long N) {
        if(N <= 4) return N;
        else if((N - 1)%5 == 0) return 1;
        else if((N-2)%5 == 0) return 2;
        else if((N-3)%5 == 0) return 3;
        else if((N-4)% 5 == 0) return 4;
        
        return -1;
    }
