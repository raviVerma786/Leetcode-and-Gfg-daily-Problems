Solution : 

class Solution
{
    public:
    void helper(Node* root,int k,int &diff){
        if(!root) return;
        
        diff = min(diff,abs(root->data - k));
        if(root->data > k) helper(root->left,k,diff);
        else helper(root->right,k,diff);
    }
    
    int minDiff(Node *root, int K)
    {
        int diff = INT_MAX;
        helper(root,K,diff);
        
        return diff;
    }
};
